# openbsd-workstation üê°

I do normally use Debian for workstations, but OpenBSD is really great for some workstations, too. I typically use OpenBSD for firewall devices with no graphical interface, but making a graphical workstation with OpenBSD is fantastic as well.

This project contains a few config files and installation materials for an OpenBSD (7.7) graphical workstation. During the installation of OpenBSD, select running the X window system and select `xenodm` for the X display manager. Once `i3` is configured, i3 is loaded after login by xenodm and will effectively replace the default desktop.

Before executing the root_setup.ksh and setup.ksh, populate ./images directory with (sphere.png and login.png) where sphere.png is set as the wallpaper and login.png is set as the login screen background.

Run the root_setup.ksh as the root user to install packages and set some system configs. Then run setup.ksh as the use that will login to the system to configure user-specific settings.

The packages are from 2025 and OpenBSD 7.7, adjust if using an older or newer release.

I have the `elvish` shell being installed outside of the OpenBSD package directly from tarball to use a newer version. Currently the package is ~ 3 years old with 0.16.3. The user setup script downloads elvish and untars in in pwd as well as installs an rc file for elvish. To copy elvish binary to `/usr/local/bin/` there is another script to run as root `root_elvish.ksh` that copies `./elvish` to `/usr/local/bin/elvish`. 

There is also a script for compiling and installing my rust CLI tools, `tools.ksh`.

## Additional steps and configurations

I'll add some more detail here soon.
