# openbsd-workstation üê°

I do normally use Debian for workstations, but OpenBSD is really great for some workstations, too. I typically use OpenBSD for firewall devices with no graphical interface, but making a graphical workstation with OpenBSD is fantastic as well.

This project contains a few config files and installation materials for an OpenBSD (7.7) graphical workstation. During the installation of OpenBSD, select running the X window system and select `xenodm` for the X display manager. Once `i3` is configured, i3 is loaded after login by xenodm and will effectively replace the default desktop.

Before executing the root_setup.ksh and setup.ksh, populate ./images directory with (sphere.png and login.png) where sphere.png is set as the wallpaper and login.png is set as the login screen background.

Run the root_setup.ksh as the root user to install packages and set some system configs. Then run setup.ksh as the use that will login to the system to configure user-specific settings.

The packages are from 2025 and OpenBSD 7.7, adjust if using an older or newer release.
